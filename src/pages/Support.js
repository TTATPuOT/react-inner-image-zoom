        <p>Most of the implementation choices for this component are based on use cases I&apos;ve encountered in the past. For example, I chose a click to zoom trigger because it was requested on previous product detail pages I've worked on. If there&apos;s a demand for zoom on hover or other additional functionality, I&apos;d be open to taking a look.</p>
